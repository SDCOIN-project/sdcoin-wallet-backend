# SDCoin Wallet Backend

## Overview

This app is a NodeJS server based on [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/).

This server uses database MongoDB.

[Config module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/config) is used for configuration. 
Configurations are stored in configuration files on the `config` folder, and can be overridden and extended by environment variables, command line parameters, or external sources.

### Config File Load Order

Files in the config directory are loaded in the following order:

```
1. config/default.json
2. config/default-{instance}.json
3. config/{deployment}.json
4. config/{deployment}-{instance}.json
5. config/local.json
6. config/(Finally, custom environment variables can override all files)
```

The `config/custom-environment-variables.json` file is used for matching variable names and config variables

### Running with Docker Compose

You can run this app with docker.
For the install docker you can read this [guide](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/).
After that you need install docker-compose. This [information](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) helps you.

#### Run With docker-compose

Go to the project directory
At the level where "docker-compose-develop.yml" is located

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-develop.yml up --build
```

You can check the server on the 3000 port (as example just open [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000))

### Running without Docker

You can start your application without docker. For this you need install [mongodb](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/) and [nodejs](https://tecadmin.net/install-latest-nodejs-npm-on-ubuntu/).

#### Preparation

Clone the project and go to path with cloned project 

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm i
```

If you can change the config, you should create new file `./config/local.json` and overwrite variables.

#### Running the app

```bash
# development
npm run start

# watch mode for development
npm run start:dev

# production mode
npm run start:prod
```

### Migrations

After install MongoDB you can use migrations for your project.

```bash
# start migrations
npm run migrate

# create migration
npm run create-migration {MIGRATION_NAME}
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# unit tests
npm run test

# e2e tests
npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
npm run test:cov
```

## Deployment
